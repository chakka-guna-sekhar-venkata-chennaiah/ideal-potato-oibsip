## 5. :ship: __Deployment via Pulling the Docker Image__

Before proceeding with the deployment using Docker, it is essential to ensure that port 9998 is available on your system. The Docker image has been built using this specified port number. If you wish to change the port number, follow the deployment process using Docker as outlined below. This will help avoid conflicts and ensure seamless communication between the Docker container and your system.

+ __Pulling the image from my registry__:

<p>&nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbspBefore proceeding with pulling the image, kindly take note that the size of the image is approximately 3.99GB.</p>

```bash
docker pull guna1/oibsip-t2-sales-predictor:latest
```



+ __Running the image__:

```bash
docker run -p 9998:8501 guna1/oibsip-t2-sales-predictor:latest
```

## 6. :ship: __Deployment using Docker__

To implement the deployment of this project in Docker and change the port number, please follow the instructions below:

1. __Check Available Ports__:
First, check the available ports on your system to find one that is not in use.

2. __Replace Port Number in Dockerfile__:
In the Dockerfile, locate the line with "EXPOSE 9998" (where 9999 is the default port). Replace this number with the desired port number from step 1.

<p>&nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbspBy following these instructions, you can set the Docker container to use your desired system port, ensuring smooth deployment and communication without conflicts.
</p>

:rotating_light:  The following Docker deployment consumes approximately 3.99GB of the Docker disk image.

+ __Build the docker image__:
  
  <p>&nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  Execute the following command to build the Docker image, replacing tagname with an appropriate tag:
  </p>   
```bash
docker build -t tagname .
```
+ __Run the Docker Container__:

    <p>&nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  Start the Docker container using the built image with the following command:
    Starting the image
    </p>

```bash
docker run -p (your_desired_port):8501 tagname:latest
```

+ __Pushing the Image to a Docker Registry__:

    <p>&nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  To avoid redeploying the image each time, you can push it to your Docker registry. Before pushing, make sure you are logged in to your Docker account using:
    </p>
```bash
docker login
```

<p>Next, push the image to your registry with:</p>

```bash
docker push account_name/image_name:latest
```
This process allows you to store and retrieve the image from the registry during future deployments, making it more efficient and accessible.
